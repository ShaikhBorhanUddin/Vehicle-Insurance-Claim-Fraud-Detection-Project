## Project Overview

Vehicle insurance fraud is a serious crime that undermines the integrity of our insurance system and drives up costs for everyone. It involves elaborate schemes where individuals conspire to submit false or exaggerated claims related to property damage or personal injuries after an accident. Common tactics include staged accidents, where criminals intentionally create collisions for profit; phantom passengers, where individuals not even present at the scene claim to have sustained severe injuries; and grossly exaggerated personal injury claims. Such fraudulent activities not only harm honest policyholders but also strain resources that could be better used for legitimate claims. It's crucial to recognize and combat these deceitful practices to protect the integrity of our insurance system.
